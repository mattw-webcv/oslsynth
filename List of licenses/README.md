For those of us who still remember the old days where everything was printed;
We're comfortable with multiple page documents- this includes legal documents.

As a nod towards, and taking a page from; this license project has a few aims.
First, to aggregate all the most relevant and known OSS licenses.
Secondly, to segment them into clear components easy for the novice reader to understand.
Thirdly, to clearly allow people and businesses to pick and choose how 'copy left' they want to go.
Fourthly, I wish to change the language conventions.
To borrow from programming conventions- most legal speak is imperative, and overly verbose and tedious.

This author wishes to adopt 'declarative' language conventions.
Which hopes to both abstract out the tedium- while preserving point, intent, and goals of the legal speak.
In short- adopting a declarative framework will ideally do away with the obligation and inherent loopholes/flaws in documents and agreements that otherwise exhaustively list every forseeable minutiae down to the fine grains of sand on a large beach.

Similar to the clause convention, I wish to employ a framework of 'parting out' a license.
The first part will be a summary and index for the particular project.
The second part onwards will begin with the 'readme'; the typical proclamation and contextual goals and acknowledged limitations.
Afterwards the itemised list of parts.
The parts being divided and sorted (In no particular prescribed order):
Firstly, the obligation of those who benefit- to contribute back any and all improvements they make
Secondly, according to what degree the developer wants open source.
Thirdly, the commercial permissions/obligations- the fact and degree.

Fourthly, TBD.
